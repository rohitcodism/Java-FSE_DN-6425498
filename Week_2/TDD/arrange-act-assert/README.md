# Arrange-Act-Assert

This project demonstrates the **Arrange-Act-Assert** (AAA) pattern for writing unit tests in Java.

## What is Arrange-Act-Assert?

Arrange-Act-Assert is a simple way to structure your tests:

1. **Arrange**: Set up the objects and data you need.
2. **Act**: Call the method or function you want to test.
3. **Assert**: Check that the result is what you expected.

## How to Use

- Look at the example test cases in the project.
- Follow the AAA pattern when writing your own tests.

## Why use AAA?

- Makes tests easy to read and understand.
- Helps you write better, more organized tests.
