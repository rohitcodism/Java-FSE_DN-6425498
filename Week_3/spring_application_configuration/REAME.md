# Exercise 1: Configuring a Basic Spring Application

This project sets up a simple Spring Framework application for managing a library. It uses Spring Core to define and wire together service and repository classes for handling books.

## **Implementation:**  
- The application uses an XML file (`applicationContext.xml`) to configure Spring beans for `BookService` and `BookRepository`.
- The main class loads the Spring context and demonstrates basic usage of these beans.
