# Exercise 4: Creating and Configuring a Maven Project

This project sets up a new Maven project called **LibraryManagement** for a library management application. The `pom.xml` file includes dependencies for Spring Context, Spring AOP, and Spring WebMVC, and configures the Maven Compiler Plugin to use Java 1.8. This setup allows you to build and run a Spring-based Java application.
