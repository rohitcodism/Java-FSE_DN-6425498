# Hands On 1: Spring Data JPA with Spring Boot and Hibernate

This project is a simple example to show how Spring Data JPA works with Spring Boot and Hibernate.

## Description

We created a basic Spring Boot application that uses Spring Data JPA to connect to a database. The app performs simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on data.

## Implementation

- Spring Boot was used to set up the project quickly.
- Spring Data JPA handled the database operations.
- Hibernate was used as the JPA provider.
- We created an entity, a repository interface, and a service to manage data.

## Output

Below is an example output from running the application:
